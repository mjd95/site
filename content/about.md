# About

I'm a London-based software engineer at Twitter. I work on the storage team, and I am generally interested in databases, monitoring, and infrastructure automation.
 
Before Twitter, I worked at the UK games company Improbable, and before that I worked as an academic mathematician. My research was in number theory, and you can find some more details about what I worked on [here](/research).

When I'm not at a computer I like to console myself by taking part in long-course triathlons. 我也花很多时间学习中文.

You can find me online at [GitHub](https://github.com/mjd95), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/martin-dickson-0a7257150/), [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/4981840), [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32468790-martin) and some other places where I keep an even more reticent presence.

This is a [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) site, based on the [hugo-flex](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-flex/) theme.
