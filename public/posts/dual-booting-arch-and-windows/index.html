  <p>I recently got a <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07CRJ9SHK/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">new
laptop</a>
which came with Windows 10 by default. Normally the first thing I do
when I get a new laptop is completely over-write the Windows
installation and install whatever Linux distribution is my favourite at
that point. This time, for gaming reasons, I decided to keep Windows and
dual boot Linux. I&rsquo;ve been happily using Arch Linux for a couple of
years now, so I decided to use that as my Linux distribution.</p>
<p>The Arch installation process is mostly straightforward, if a bit time
consuming. The one exception is that using <code>fdisk</code> to manage partitions
can be a bit intimidating for inexperienced users like myself. This is
especially true when you&rsquo;re trying to keep a working UEFI Windows
installation in the background, as this involves a number of partitions
in itself.</p>
<p>To save myself any worries, I decided to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Install Ubuntu alongside Windows, using the GUI that provides for
partitioning to sort out my hard disk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Overwrite that Ubuntu installation with an Arch Linux installation</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This worked pretty well. Installing Ubuntu is of course easy. Installing
Arch in an already existing partition is also pretty straightforward.
The only pain point I can remember is that I wasn&rsquo;t sure if I would have
to install a bootloader when I installed Arch. I tried without. When I
booted again I got to the <code>grub&gt;</code> screen, so whatever bootloader I was
using didn&rsquo;t know where to look for configuration. I couldn&rsquo;t work out
how to boot in to Arch from there so I just booted from the USB again
and mounted the partition I was trying to install on as usual. I
<code>chroot</code>ed in again and set up GRUB correctly, and it worked after that.</p>
<p>Since I had to run through a couple of times, I got very used to
connecting to my WIFI network from the command line. The commands to do
this are</p>
<pre><code>iw dev # to get the name of the network interface, e..g `wlp1s0` 
rfkill unblock wifi # may be unnecessary for you
ip link set wlp1s0 up
wpa_passphrase &lt;network_SSID&gt; &gt;&gt; /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf
wpa_supplicant -B -D wext -i wlp1s0 -c /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf
iw wlp1s0 # should look happy
dhclient wlp1s0 # get ip address; hangs if wrong password above
ping www.archlinux.org
</code></pre><p>I had to do that a few times, which was one of the things that slowed me
down most during the installation. Other than that things went fairly
smoothly!</p>
