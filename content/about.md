# About

I'm a software engineer at the UK games company [Improbable](https://improbable.io/).  I spend most of my time working on our backend infrastructure.  My main focus is on monitoring performance and gameplay metrics, making heavy use of a [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) and [Thanos](https://github.com/improbable-eng/thanos).
    
I generally enjoy playing around with technology.  Outside of my day job, I spend most of my computer time on machine learning.  I also have a soft spot for implementing retro video games in OpenGL.  I don't have a favourite programming language, but if I did it would be Rust.
    
Before becoming a software engineer I worked as an academic mathematician.  My research was in number theory, you can find some more details about what I worked on [here](/research).

When I'm not at a computer, I like to console myself by taking part in endurance sports.  I haven't decided if I'm a runner or a triathlete yet, but I definitely get a kick out of both.  I'm a member of [Wimbledon Windmilers](https://windmilers.org.uk) and [Clapham Chasers](https://www.claphamchasers.co.uk/), [competing](https://thepowerof10.info/athletes/profile.aspx?athleteid=771959) for the former.

You can find me online at [GitHub](https://github.com/mjd95), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/martin-dickson-0a7257150/), [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/4981840), and some other places where I keep an even more reticent presence.

This is a [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) site, based on the [hugo-flex](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-flex/) theme.
