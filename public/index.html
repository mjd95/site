  Today&rsquo;s paper is a DeepMind paper from 2017 NeurIPS. It&rsquo;s about relational reasoning: how we can build systems that understand entities and the relationships between them, and make inferences based on those entities and relationships. A purely symbolic approach to AI is going to be happy approaching things from this perspective, but such systems do not deal with noise and uncertainty well. At the opposite end of the spectrum we have statistical learning techniques, which deal with noise well but struggle to learn complex relations between entities, especially if there is not a plethora of data about the relations to train on.

  First up is the Raft paper. Raft is a consensus algorithm, which is to say that you have a collection of servers that you would like to all compute the same state machine. This is obviously useful for fault tolerance in distributed systems.
Paxos is a well-known consensus algorithm. Everything I&rsquo;ve read about Paxos talks about it being difficult to understand, and this paper is no different. In fact, inspired by the Paxos issue, understandability is a first-class goal of their algorithm design.

  I&rsquo;m going to start a regularly series where I try to read a couple of academic papers per week. The plan will be that on Tuesdays I read classic computer science papers (of which I have read embarrassingly few) and on Thursdays I will read more recent machine learning papers (of which I have also read embarrassingly few). I have no formal education in either computer science of machine learning so this might be a disastrously bad idea, but I&rsquo;ll see how it goes.

  I&rsquo;ve been reading the book Deep Learning (Goodfellow et. al) recently. I&rsquo;m doing this with a view to filling in gaps about my deep learning knowledge, as most of my learning in the past has been from random blogs posts and the occassional research paper.
Since this is a fairly long book and I am constrained in the amount of time I can dedicate to reading it, I&rsquo;ve tried an experiment with keeping quick markdown notes of what I&rsquo;ve read.

  I was recently setting up a website for a small travel blog. We wanted a reasonable looking static site, content supplied via markdown files, hosted on a custom domain and supporting TLS. I&rsquo;m not sure what the quickest way to do this is in 2019, but it probably involves Netlify. I went down a Hugo / Google Domains / App Engine route, and it was still pretty slick.
First the static site generator.

  I&rsquo;ve been learning Rust recently. I started off with the Rust book, which is excellent, particularly for people like me who don&rsquo;t have a huge amount of experience in lower level languages. (I could well imagine more experienced readers would find it quite verbose, though). The final project in the book was building a small multithreaded webserver, which I think is a really good thing to build when assessing any new language.

  At work, we have a number of dynamically provisioned backend services. When they are created, an entry (&lt;dynamic-part&gt;, &lt;ip&gt;) is written to our etcd cluster. The URLs are specified by a well-known scheme, so a client knows which URL to dial - something like &lt;dynamic-part&gt;.&lt;static-part&gt;.com. There is a reverse proxy running providing a resolution service, and there is a wildcard DNS entry *.&lt;static-part&gt;.com which points to that service. The remaining resolution is done with an etcd lookup.

  I recently got a new laptop which came with Windows 10 by default. Normally the first thing I do when I get a new laptop is completely over-write the Windows installation and install whatever Linux distribution is my favourite at that point. This time, for gaming reasons, I decided to keep Windows and dual boot Linux. I&rsquo;ve been happily using Arch Linux for a couple of years now, so I decided to use that as my Linux distribution.
