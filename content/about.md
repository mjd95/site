# About

I'm a London-based software engineer at the UK games company [Improbable](https://improbable.io/). I spend most of my time working on our backend infrastructure. I've got a fair amount of experience in monitoring, particularly with [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) and [Thanos](https://github.com/improbable-eng/thanos). More recently, I've been working on automating scheduling and provisioning for on-prem machines hosting Kubernetes clusters.
 
I generally enjoy learning about and playing around with technology. I'm trying to [blog](/posts) regularly about academic papers. Code-wise, I'm spending a lot of time with OpenGL right now, but I haven't decided if it's a game or an engine yet.
    
Before becoming a software engineer I worked as an academic mathematician. My research was in number theory, you can find some more details about what I worked on [here](/research).

When I'm not at a computer, I like to console myself by taking part in endurance sports. My background is in [running](https://thepowerof10.info/athletes/profile.aspx?athleteid=771959) but I'm increasingly enjoying long-course triathlon. I'm a member of both [Wimbledon Windmilers](https://windmilers.org.uk) and [Clapham Chasers](https://www.claphamchasers.co.uk/). 我也花很多时间学习中文.

You can find me online at [GitHub](https://github.com/mjd95), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/martin-dickson-0a7257150/), [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/4981840), [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32468790-martin) and some other places where I keep an even more reticent presence.

This is a [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) site, based on the [hugo-flex](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-flex/) theme.
