# Research

Up until 2017, I worked as a research mathematician.  I quit academia as university life ultimately wasn't for me, but I still love mathematics itself.
    
My area of interest was number theory, specifically [automorphic form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automorphic_form). Most of the things I worked on were inspired by either the [Langlands program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langlands_program) or [Deligne's conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_values_of_L-functions).  My work was a mixture of theory and computation.

My PhD was focused on [Siegel modular forms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siegel_modular_form).  It included classical questions about Fourier coefficients and Hecke eigenvalues [1](https://arxiv.org/abs/1310.1745), [3](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.09069), as well as questions about L-functions and statistics of Hecke eigenvalues [2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5584).

After my PhD, I continued to work on Siegel modular forms, this time on special values of their L-functions [4](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.07204), [6](https://arxiv.org).  I also worked on some computational aspects of [classical modular forms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_form) and their local Galois representations [5](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.00774), [7](https://arxiv.org).
